# Pascal-Triangle-Simulator
This app generates 'pascal triangles' from a given root

To generate a triangle input reset(root) in the browser console

root is an array that contains the numbers of the root

examples:

#1: reset([0,1,0]) will generate

In cases like example #2 you might want to 'cut' the triangle because the values of the rows under the fifth are wrong

To generate and cut the triangle input reset(root, rows)

rows is the number of roots you want to generate

reset([0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0], 4) will generate
